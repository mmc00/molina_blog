Hi, my name is Marlon Molina, and I am a data scientist. My career started as a research assistant at the National University in the School of Economics. At the moment, I work at the Ministry of Foreign Trade of Costa Rica as an analyst/researcher. I have a master's degree in economic development.

My thesis topic was on VAT tax in the context of General Equilibrium (convex optimization problem) and my main interest now is Machine Learning. I believe that with the data revolution, algorithms can help us to solve many problems in society,
and I believe that with these technological changes we have a huge opportunity but also a big challenge, to keep this knowledge available to everyone.


In addition to my academic and professional background, I like to play fifa (I'm not too good for the times I've spent playing), read and I like to run. Exercising changed my life and I encourage everyone I know to do it, so keep moving! 

I am a family guy, so I try to spend most of my time with them because I love them and enjoy sharing with them.
Also, I like to walk my dogs and go to the beach whenever I can (I live relatively close to the coast), and I think the best sunsets in the world are here, in Costa Rica, to give an example:
