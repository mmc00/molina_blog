Hi, My name is Marlon Molina an I am an Economist. My career started as research assistant at Universidad Nacional.
Right now, I work at the Ministry of Foreign Trade of Costa Rica Rica as Analyst/Research Analyst. I have a master's degree in economic development.
My thesis topic was on the VAT tax in the context of the General Equilibrium (convex optimization problem).
My main interest at the moment is Machine Learning.

Besides my academic and professional background, I like to play fifa, read and I like to run. 
I like to walk with my dogs and go to the beach whenever I can (I live relatively close to the coast). 
I am a family guy, so I try to spend most of my time with them.
